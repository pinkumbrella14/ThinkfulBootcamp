You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.\n",

Purchases of the three products could also be compared. The results of all these comparisons would then inform which to advertise. For example, if the company is interested in selling more of the least selling gadget, then those could be advertised vs if the company is interested in maintaining sales of the best or second-best selling gadget.*\n"

For example, sign ups may reduce following a specific month or holiday and could be tested to see if the current slow down is actually normal. I would also test the effectivenss of the marketing - for example, does marketing actually lead to more sign ups?*\n"
