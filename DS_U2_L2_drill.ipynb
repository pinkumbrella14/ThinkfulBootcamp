    "- Classification, limited to some available color choices.\n",
    "- Either regression or classification. If classification, there will be some limited number of choices available.\n",
    "- Classification, because the outcome is basically yes/no.\n",
    "- Classification, because there is likely a limit on the most number of times someone can get sick in one year.\n",
    "- Classification, because itâ€™s essentially assigning a probability to yes/no outcome.\n",
    "- Classification, because limited to a choice of medicine."
